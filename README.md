Using Pandas in Python to explore a big deal of records and to calculate revenues from separate pieces of data.
## 2. Datasets
- prices.csv: records of product's history price changes in Sep 2018
- sales.csv: records of product's sales in Sep 2018
### 3. Step-to-do
I will use data wrangling tools to calculate the total revenue of each product at each price. The solution will be applicable to similar datasets with large numbers of records.
